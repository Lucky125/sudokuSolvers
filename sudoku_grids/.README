# Sudoku Files

For this project, I used files from [t-dillon](https://github.com/t-dillon/tdoku/blob/master/data.zip). You are, of course, free to use any file you find. The files need to be in the following format:

- Each line in the file represents one sudoku,
- A sudoku should be stored in 'reading order'; the digits of a sudoku grid should be written from left to right, then top to bottom,
- Any symbol, or indeed a collection of symbols, can be used to represent an empty space,
- No symbol can or should be used to represent the end of a row/block,
- Any line that starts with # will be ignored.

Furthermore, any file that starts with a period (i.e. .sudoku_file) will be ignored by the program.

Simply place the files into this folder, and the program should detect them.
